So I just got back home from the first day of Chicago's WordCamp 2011 held at the lovely Depaul University in downtown Chicago. Man, what a great experience - I just love the inspiration and the idea sharing that goes on at these conferences. 

Some highlights of the day were:

<ul>
<li>Dave Tufts' <a href="http://kickpress.org/">KickPress WordPress API</a></li>
<li>TJ Stein's great talk on developing fast &amp; scalable servers</li>
<li>Jason McCreary's talk about <a href="http://jason.pureconcepts.net/articles/wordcamp-chicago-talk-configuring-multiple-environments-wordpress?PHPSESSID=76507cc009dfe9ea72300f9a2129f2ef">developing WordPress on multiple environments</a> (hooray for finally perfecting my workflow! More on this later!)</li>
<li>And finally Brian Richards motivational Developing for Success in which he reveals he's released his development framework <a href="http://wpstartbox.com/">Startbox</a> for free!</li>
</ul>

Also, at the after party I had the opportunity to meet the fantastic Ryan Imel from <a href="http://wpcandy.com/">WP Candy</a>, which was awesome.

All in all a great day - and I'm looking forward to more of the same tomorrow.

Cheers!
