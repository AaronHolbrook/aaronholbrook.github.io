Some thoughts I had on my way home from WordCamp Grand Rapids 2012:

<ul>
	<li>A long car ride is better shared</li>
	<li>Even better: a long car is best shared by a <a title="Brad Parbs, Internet Rockstar" href="http://bradparbs.com">fellow geek</a> who you can learn lots from</li>
	<li>Pre-conference speaker parties are the best type of party</li>
	<li>Grand Rapids is full of <a title="Grand Rapids, Brewery Town" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=brewery&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=42.96336,-85.668086&amp;sspn=0.311537,0.541077&amp;t=m&amp;z=11">breweries</a></li>
	<li>These breweries contain lots of good food</li>
	<li>Don't leave your brand new macbook air box sitting on your car seat parked in a parking lot</li>
	<li>If you decide to ignore the previous rule then don't be surprised when someone has broken into your car and stolen your laptop</li>
	<li><a title="Brian Richards, Startbox founder" href="http://rzen.net/">Brian Richards</a> (<a title="@rzen" href="https://twitter.com/rzen">@rzen</a>) knows how to make a brilliant conference badge/book</li>
	<li><a title="Ryan Imel, wpcandy" href="http://ryanimel.com/">Ryan Imel</a> (<a title="@ryanimel" href="http://twitter.com/ryanimel">@ryanimel</a>) puts on a hell of show</li>
	<li>Brian Richards also knows how to organize <a title="Grand Rapids WordCamp 2012" href="http://2012.grandrapids.wordcamp.org/">one hell of a conference</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=%23bathroomnirvana&amp;src=hash">#bathroomnirvana</a> is a thing</li>
	<li>I should really time out my speech a little better so I don't finish at the 13 minute mark</li>
	<li>Free hoodies and shirts are really awesome</li>
	<li>Mark Jaquith is really tall!</li>
	<li>I think <a title="John James Jacoby, BuddyPress Lead" href="https://twitter.com/jjj">@jjj</a> &amp; <a title="Mark Jaquith, core WordPress developer" href="https://twitter.com/markjaquith">@jaquith</a> were literally the giants on who's shoulders we stand on</li>
	<li><a title="Andy Stratton, teddy bear" href="https://twitter.com/theandystratton">@theandystratton</a> is a really nice guy (you know underneath the hard exterior)</li>
	<li>Constant stomache butterflies is not a fun way to spend 5+ days</li>
	<li>meeting my peers in the WP community is such an inspiring experience</li>
	<li>I continue to be impressed by how much utility there is in twitter</li>
	<li>Most especially at a gathering of people (like at a conference)</li>
	<li>To be so closely tied to people digitally and for that to be completely irrelevant to physical proximity is a wonder that my brain is still trying to decipher</li>
	<li><del>Conferences</del> WordCamps are insanely amazing!</li>
</ul>
