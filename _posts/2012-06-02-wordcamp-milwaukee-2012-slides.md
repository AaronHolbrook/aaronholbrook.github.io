Thanks to everyone who attended my session onÂ WordPress and Version Control!

I promised slides and unfortunately had a bit of a hiccup with bit.ly. Here are the slides:

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="50356cf4eca5f60002003eef" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

Feel free to comment or shoot me a message on twitter if you want to talk @aaronjholbrook.

<strong>Update: </strong>slides are now up on speakerdeck. Enjoy!
