I'm Aaron Holbrook, Director of Web Engineering at [Zeek](https://zeek.com).

I’ve used WordPress since 2004, am a [core contributor](http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaronholbrook) and am an author of [multiple plugins](https://profiles.wordpress.org/aaronholbrook#content-plugins) and [packages](https://packagist.org/packages/a7/).

I build amazing WordPress powered publishing solutions and architect robust deployment and delivery processes.

I enjoy helping others become better developers and have spoken at several conferences including [WordCamp Milwaukee](http://2012.milwaukee.wordcamp.org/speakers/#aaron-holbrook), [WordCamp Grand Rapids](http://2012.grandrapids.wordcamp.org/speakers/#aaron-holbrook), [WordCamp Providence](http://2012.providence.wordcamp.org/session/wordpress-and-version-control/), [WordCamp Chicago](http://2012.chicago.wordcamp.org/speakers/#aaron-holbrook) and CMS Expo.

If you’re interested, you could totally catch some of my talks over on [WordPress.tv](http://wordpress.tv/speakers/aaron-holbrook/).

I built a [mechanism](https://github.com/a7/wpe-cache-flush) to easily clear the cache on WP Engine.

I created a [plugin](https://github.com/a7/seeder) to perform heavy or infrequent actions in a controlled and reproducible manner.

I put together a pretty neat way to [sync your dotfiles](http://aaronjholbrook.com/my-solution-to-quickly-syncing-bash_profile-on-multiple-machines/) quickly and easily across many machines.
